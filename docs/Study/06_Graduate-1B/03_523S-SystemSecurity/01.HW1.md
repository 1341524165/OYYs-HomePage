## 1. VirtualBox Installation

To install VirtualBox, download the software from the official website: [VirtualBox Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

During the installation, you may encounter the following error message:  
**“Missing Dependencies: Python Core / win32api”**

This issue may arise under the following circumstances:
1. **Python is not installed:**  
    If Python is not already installed on your PC, download and install it from the official Python website: [Python Downloads for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

2. **Python is installed, but dependencies are missing:**  
    If Python is already installed, try to run the following command in the Command Prompt (cmd) to resolve the issue:  
    ```shell
    pip install pywin32
    ```

## 2. Create a New Virtual Machine of Ubuntu

Download the pre-built SEED Ubuntu 20.04 VM from the following website: [SEED Ubuntu 20.04 VM](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/labsetup.html).


When creating a new virtual machine in VirtualBox, you can skip the **ISO image** selection since you will be using a pre-built VM in the VDI format.  
Make sure to set the **Type** to `Linux`.  
![First Step](./2-1.png)

Next step is allocating dedicated memory for the VM. 1024 MB should be sufficient.  
The allocation depends on your computer’s available memory -- If your computer has more RAM, you can increase accordingly. The more memory you give to the VM, the better the performance you will get.  
![Memory Allocation](2-2.png)

Select the **"Use an Existing Virtual Hard Disk File"** option and add the downloaded SEED Ubuntu 20.04 VDI file.  
![HardDisk](./2-3.png)

After the VM is created, we need to modify some settings to enable the following features:  
1. copy and paste between the host and the VM
2. drag and drop files between the host and the VM  

Follow the steps shown below to enable these features:

## 3. Configure ~/.bashrc

To configure ~/.bashrc to display the date and your name in the terminal prompt, follow these steps:  
1. Open the terminal in the VM:  
![Terminal](3-1.png)

2. Open the .bashrc file in a text editor (Here, we use nano as the example):  
    ```shell
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```

3. Add a line at the end of the file to modify the `PS1` variable, to display the date and the username in the terminal prompt:  
    ```shell
    PS1='\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\][`date "+%D"`]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]YOUR_NAME_HERE\[\033[00m\]\$'
    ```

4. What is `PS1`? What is the format of the `PS1` variable?  
    - `PS1` stands for Prompt String 1, which stands for **primary prompt** that determines the content and format of the prompt displayed in the terminal.  
    - The format of the `PS1` variable is a string that contains escape sequences and special characters to display information such as the current working directory, username, hostname, and date in the terminal prompt:

5. The modified terminal prompt will appear as follows:

## 4. Take a Snapshot
To take a snapshot of the VM, choose the **"Take Snapshot"** option from the **"Machine"** menu in VirtualBox:

## 5. Facilitate Grading
To facilitate the grading work, I will show the prompt for *possible points* one by one according to the rubric in this section.

| Possible points | Rubric item                                                                                                      | Prompt        |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 2                | Successful installation and configuration of the VM. <br /> You must include a screenshot showing your prompt to get this credit. | ![Installation&Configuration Screenshot](./5-1.png) |
| 1                | A snapshot was taken. Take a screenshot of your snapshot.                                                      | ![Snapshot Screenshot](./5-2.png) <br /> ![Snapshot Screen 2](5-3.png) |
| 2                | Sufficient documentation and repeatable notes. Hence, someone* else can reproduce your work. <br /> *someone else refers to another student taking this course, not a random person who never used a computer before. You don’t have to provide basic instructions such as how to open a browser or how to open a folder.                  | Documentation included above |
