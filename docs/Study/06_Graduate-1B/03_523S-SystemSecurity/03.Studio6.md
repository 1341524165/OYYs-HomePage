## Task 1: Experimenting with Bash Function

![Task 1](https://jcqn.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img_blog/523SS/Studio6/task1.png)

As shown in the image above, two command lines both include the environment variable `() { :;}; echo vulnerable`.  
However, only the installed vulnerable version of bash (**bash_shellshock**) outputs the string `vulnerable`, printing the injected command from the environment variable.  
In contrast, the patched version (**/bin/bash**) only outputs `test`, ignoring the malicious code.

## Task 2: Passing Data to Bash via Environment Variable

1. Default `curl` Request:  
   ![Default](https://jcqn.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img_blog/523SS/Studio6/task2_default.png)

    We can see the HTTP headers sent by `curl`, including **Host**, **User-Agent**, and **Accept** etc.

2. Using `-A` option (_User-Agent_):
   ![User-Agent](https://jcqn.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img_blog/523SS/Studio6/task2-A.png)

    By using the `-A` option, we notice that the **User-Agent** field has been changed.

3. Using `-e` option (_Referer_):
   ![Referer](https://jcqn.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img_blog/523SS/Studio6/task2-e.png)

    By using the `-e` option, we set the **Referer** field.

4. Using `-H` option (_Custom Header_):
   ![Custom Header](https://jcqn.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img_blog/523SS/Studio6/task2-H.png)

    By using the `-H` option, we adds a custom header, which becomes an environment variable also prefixed with **HTTP\_**.

So when a web server, like **Apache**, processes a CGI request, it passes HTTP headers as environment variables to the CGI script. And the **bash_shellshock**, invoked by the `getenv.cgi`, can interpret these environment variables.  
Because the Shellshock exploits environment variables to execute code, the `curl` options can be used to inject malicious code.
