# Final Report


## 1. Introduction

The goal of this analysis is to understand the factors which impact the compressive strength of concrete, a critical property in construction.  
Predicting compressive concrete strength based on component proportions can help manufacturers optimize material usage and ensure structural reliability.  
So via this analysis, we aim to provide practical recommendations for real-world applications, by applying data mining techniques, particularly linear regression, including both custom-built via gradient descent and statistically validated using software "statsmodels".


## 2. Results

### 2.1 Part B and Part C Models

### Model from Part B - Q2.3

Multivariate Linear Regression with Gradient Descent (Pre-processed Predictors, Raw Response)

- Parameters:
  - m: [ 1.03198275e+01  2.78827073e+01  7.45159185e+00 -5.12468027e+00 3.11466814e+00  3.57357621e-01  7.71318550e-03  1.02909491e+01 ]
  - b: 28.0044317376294
  - $ \alpha $: 0.01
  - epochs: 5000

- Peformance:
  - **MSE** on Testing Data: 67.87198233457188
  - **VE** ($ R^2 $) on Testing Data: 0.6894830160041516

- Why Trustworthy?:
  High R-squared value (0.69), explaining 69% of the variance in compressive strength, as the pre-processed predictors enhances its reliability.

- Recommendations:
  - Increase `Cement` and `Blast Furnace Slag` proportions, while decreasing `Water` content, to improve strength significantly.
  - `Fine Aggregate` has a smallest impact on strength. So we may reduce its use to lower costs.

### Model from Part C - Q2.3

Multivariate Linear Regression with Statsmodels (Pre-processed Predictors, Raw Response)

- Parameters:
  - m: [ 15.3584  50.0728  22.4310  -2.0918  0.1704  3.5054  4.1012  10.5111 ]
  - b: 19.9179

- Peformance:
  - **MSE** on Testing Data: 80.73582880174308
  - **VE** ($ R^2 $) on Testing Data: 0.6306304133516871

- Why Trustworthy?:
  Fitted with **statsmodels** (which means this model optimizes using **Closed Form Solution**), showing a high R-squared value (0.63), and the use of pre-processed predictors ensures its reliability.

- Recommendations:
  - Components suggestion for `Cement`, `Blast Furnace Slag` and `water` are consistent with the previous model.
  - The `fly ash`'s weight of this model has become greater than the `cement`. So it could also be considered as one of the most significant factors.
  - In this model, `Superplasticizer` turns to be the minimal impact feature. So we may reduce its use to lower costs.

## 3. Methods

### Model from Part B - Q2.3

I used a multivariate linear regression model optimized with **gradient descent**. The algorithm iteratively adjusts coefficients (m) and intercept (b) to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between predictions and true values.

- Pre-processed?
  Yes. As following:  
| **Component**                                             | **Transformation**                         | **Reason**                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cement (component 1) (kg in a m^3 mixture)                 | Standardization                            | Because it ranges widely.                                                                      |
| Blast Furnace Slag (component 2) (kg in a m^3 mixture)     | Normalization                              | Because there are so many zeros.                                                               |
| Fly Ash (component 3) (kg in a m^3 mixture)                | Normalization                              | Many zeros.                                                                                    |
| Water (component 4) (kg in a m^3 mixture)                  | N/A                                        |                                                                                                 |
| Superplasticizer (component 5) (kg in a m^3 mixture)       | Normalization                              | Many values are near zero.                                                                     |
| Coarse Aggregate (component 6) (kg in a m^3 mixture)       | Standardization                            | It is with consistent range.                                                                   |
| Fine Aggregate (component 7) (kg in a m^3 mixture)         | Standardization                            | Consistent range.                                                                              |
| Age (day)                                                 | Log and Standardization                    | Data points are mostly concentrated in the low age area.                                        |
| Concrete compressive strength (MPa, megapascals)           | Log and Standardization                    | It seems that it is also a little bit right-skewed, so I prefer to apply log transformation first and then standardization. |
